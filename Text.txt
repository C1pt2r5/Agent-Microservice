Step 2: Local Development Setup
Start Development Environment
# Build the project
npm run build

# Start in development mode
npm run dev

# Or start individual services
npm run start:chatbot
npm run start:fraud-detection
npm run start:recommendation
Run Tests
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
☁️ Step 3: Cloud Deployment (Recommended)
Configure Google Cloud
# Authenticate with Google Cloud
gcloud auth login

# Set your project
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID

# Enable required APIs
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable monitoring.googleapis.com
Deploy to GKE (Production-Ready)
# Deploy everything to Google Kubernetes Engine
./scripts/deploy-gke.ps1 -Environment development -CreateCluster

# This will:
# - Create a GKE cluster
# - Build and push Docker images
# - Deploy all services
# - Set up networking and ingress
# - Configure monitoring
Set Up Monitoring
# Deploy monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
./scripts/setup-monitoring.ps1 -Environment development

# Access monitoring dashboards:
# - Grafana: Check output for URL and credentials
# - Prometheus: For metrics and alerts
# - Jaeger: For distributed tracing
🐳 Step 4: Local Docker Setup (Alternative)
If you prefer to run locally with Docker:

# Build all Docker images
docker-compose build

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f
🧪 Step 5: Verify Everything Works
Run Health Checks
# Check all services are healthy
kubectl get pods -n agentic-dev  # For GKE deployment
# OR
docker-compose ps               # For local Docker

# Test API endpoints
curl http://localhost:8082/health  # Chatbot
curl http://localhost:8083/health  # Fraud Detection
curl http://localhost:8085/health  # Recommendation
Run End-to-End Tests
# Run comprehensive test suite
npm run test:e2e

# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Run specific scenarios
npm run test:fraud-scenarios
npm run test:recommendation-accuracy
📊 Step 6: Access Your System
Service Endpoints
After deployment, you'll have access to:

Chatbot API: http://your-domain/api/chatbot
Fraud Detection: http://your-domain/api/fraud
Recommendations: http://your-domain/api/recommendations
MCP Gateway: http://your-domain/api/mcp
A2A Hub: http://your-domain/api/a2a
Monitoring Dashboards
Grafana: System metrics and custom dashboards
Prometheus: Raw metrics and alerting rules
Jaeger: Distributed tracing and performance analysis
🔧 Step 7: Configuration
Environment-Specific Configuration
# Validate configuration
./scripts/validate-config.ts --environment development

# Deploy configuration updates
./scripts/config-deploy.ps1 -Environment development

# Check configuration consistency
./scripts/validate-config.ts --check-consistency
🚨 Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:

Check the logs:

kubectl logs -f deployment/chatbot-agent -n agentic-dev
Use the troubleshooting guide:

Open docs/runbooks/troubleshooting-guide.md
Follow the step-by-step diagnostic procedures
Check system health:

kubectl get pods -n agentic-dev
kubectl top nodes
📚 Next Steps
Once everything is running:

Explore the APIs using the provided endpoints
Monitor performance through Grafana dashboards
Review logs for any issues or optimization opportunities
Scale services based on your load requirements
Customize agents for your specific use cases
🎯 Quick Start Commands
For the fastest setup:

# Complete setup in one go
npm install
./scripts/deploy-gke.ps1 -Environment development -CreateCluster
./scripts/setup-monitoring.ps1 -Environment development
npm run test:e2e
This will get your entire agentic microservices system up and running with monitoring and testing in about 15-20 minutes!
