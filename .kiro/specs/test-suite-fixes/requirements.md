# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current test suite has extensive failures across multiple components including TypeScript compilation errors, missing properties, type safety issues, and test assertion failures. This feature aims to systematically fix all test failures to ensure a robust, maintainable test suite that provides confidence in the codebase quality and enables reliable continuous integration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors in tests to be resolved, so that the test suite can run without build failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the test suite THEN all TypeScript compilation errors SHALL be resolved
2. WHEN a test file imports types or interfaces THEN all required properties SHALL be properly defined
3. WHEN ServiceEndpoint configurations are used in tests THEN the circuitBreakerThreshold property SHALL be included
4. WHEN accessing potentially undefined properties THEN proper type guards or optional chaining SHALL be used

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing methods and properties to be implemented, so that tests can access the expected API surface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call isAgentHealthy() on BaseAgent THEN the method SHALL exist and return appropriate health status
2. WHEN tests use GeminiClientFactory methods THEN all referenced methods SHALL exist with correct signatures
3. WHEN tests access agent response payloads THEN proper null/undefined handling SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN factory methods are called THEN they SHALL accept the correct parameter types and return expected instances

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test timeouts and assertion failures to be fixed, so that tests run reliably and complete within expected timeframes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests involve async operations THEN appropriate timeouts SHALL be configured
2. WHEN tests make assertions about response data THEN the assertions SHALL match actual response structure
3. WHEN tests involve streaming or event-based operations THEN proper event handling and cleanup SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN tests involve circuit breakers or rate limiting THEN proper test setup and teardown SHALL ensure consistent behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test data and mock configurations, so that tests are reliable and don't have flaky behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests use mock data THEN the mock data SHALL match the expected interface contracts
2. WHEN tests involve compression or serialization THEN the test assertions SHALL account for actual compression behavior
3. WHEN tests involve file path operations THEN path separators SHALL be handled consistently across platforms
4. WHEN tests involve timing-sensitive operations THEN appropriate delays and synchronization SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper test isolation and cleanup, so that tests don't interfere with each other and resources are properly managed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN all timers and async operations SHALL be properly cleaned up
2. WHEN tests use external resources THEN proper setup and teardown SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN tests involve worker processes THEN graceful shutdown SHALL be ensured
4. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN they SHALL not interfere with each other's state
