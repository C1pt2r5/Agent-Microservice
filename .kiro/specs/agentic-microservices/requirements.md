# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to enhance an existing microservice application (Bank of Anthos / Online Boutique) with intelligent AI agents running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The solution will add real-time decision-making capabilities, anomaly detection, and personalized experiences without modifying the core application code. The AI agents will operate as external containerized services that integrate via APIs, creating a modular "AI brain" that extends the application's capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want to deploy AI agents as containerized services on GKE, so that I can enhance existing microservices without modifying their core code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying AI agents THEN the system SHALL run each agent as a separate container on GKE
2. WHEN integrating with existing microservices THEN the system SHALL connect via external APIs without requiring code changes to the base application
3. WHEN scaling agents THEN the system SHALL leverage Kubernetes native scaling capabilities
4. IF an agent fails THEN the base microservice application SHALL continue operating normally

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want an AI chatbot to answer my queries about transactions, orders, and account details, so that I can get instant support without waiting for human assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer asks about transactions THEN the chatbot agent SHALL retrieve and present transaction history
2. WHEN a customer inquires about orders THEN the chatbot agent SHALL provide order status and details
3. WHEN a customer requests account information THEN the chatbot agent SHALL display relevant account details
4. WHEN the chatbot cannot answer a query THEN it SHALL gracefully escalate or provide alternative support options
5. IF the chatbot service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide fallback support mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want real-time fraud and anomaly detection, so that suspicious activities can be identified and prevented immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a transaction occurs THEN the fraud detection agent SHALL analyze it for suspicious patterns in real-time
2. WHEN anomalous behavior is detected THEN the system SHALL flag the activity and trigger appropriate responses
3. WHEN analyzing banking activities THEN the agent SHALL apply machine learning models to detect fraud patterns
4. WHEN monitoring shopping behavior THEN the agent SHALL identify unusual purchasing patterns
5. IF fraud is detected THEN the system SHALL notify relevant stakeholders and take preventive actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want personalized product and service recommendations, so that I can discover relevant offerings tailored to my preferences and behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer browses products THEN the recommendation agent SHALL suggest relevant items based on their history
2. WHEN analyzing customer behavior THEN the agent SHALL generate personalized financial service recommendations
3. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider real-time context and preferences
4. WHEN multiple recommendation sources exist THEN the agent SHALL intelligently merge and prioritize suggestions
5. IF recommendation data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide default or popular recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI system administrator, I want agents to collaborate and share insights via Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, so that the overall system intelligence is enhanced through inter-agent communication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need to share information THEN they SHALL communicate via the A2A protocol
2. WHEN the fraud detection agent identifies suspicious activity THEN it SHALL notify the chatbot agent for customer communication
3. WHEN the recommendation agent needs transaction context THEN it SHALL request insights from the fraud detection agent
4. WHEN agents collaborate THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency and avoid conflicts
5. IF agent communication fails THEN each agent SHALL continue operating independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) for seamless API integration, so that AI agents can connect to existing microservice APIs without code modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to microservice APIs THEN agents SHALL use MCP for standardized integration
2. WHEN API schemas change THEN the MCP integration SHALL adapt without requiring agent code changes
3. WHEN multiple agents access the same API THEN MCP SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
4. WHEN API authentication is required THEN MCP SHALL manage credentials securely
5. IF an API is unavailable THEN MCP SHALL provide appropriate error handling and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to leverage Gemini AI models for intelligent decision-making, so that agents can provide sophisticated analysis and responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents need AI processing THEN they SHALL utilize Gemini AI models for decision-making
2. WHEN processing natural language queries THEN the system SHALL use Gemini for understanding and response generation
3. WHEN analyzing patterns THEN agents SHALL leverage Gemini's machine learning capabilities
4. WHEN model responses are needed THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits and quotas appropriately
5. IF Gemini services are unavailable THEN agents SHALL provide degraded functionality or fallback responses

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to use the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for rapid agent creation and orchestration, so that new AI capabilities can be developed and deployed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new agents THEN developers SHALL use ADK templates and tools for rapid development
2. WHEN orchestrating multiple agents THEN ADK SHALL provide coordination and management capabilities
3. WHEN deploying agents THEN ADK SHALL automate containerization and Kubernetes deployment
4. WHEN monitoring agents THEN ADK SHALL provide observability and debugging tools
5. IF agent deployment fails THEN ADK SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability, so that I can ensure the AI-enhanced system operates reliably and efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agents are running THEN the system SHALL provide health checks and status monitoring
2. WHEN performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL generate alerts and diagnostic information
3. WHEN analyzing system behavior THEN comprehensive logs and metrics SHALL be available
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN the system SHALL provide tracing across agent interactions
5. IF monitoring systems fail THEN agents SHALL continue operating with local logging capabilities
