# Design Document

## Overview

The Agentic Microservices system enhances existing microservice applications (Bank of Anthos / Online Boutique) with intelligent AI agents deployed on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). The architecture follows a non-intrusive approach where AI agents operate as external containerized services that integrate via standardized protocols without modifying the core application code.

The system implements three primary AI agents (Chatbot, Fraud Detection, and Recommendation) that collaborate through Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol and integrate with existing microservices via Model Context Protocol (MCP). All agents leverage Gemini AI models for intelligent decision-making and are developed using the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for rapid deployment and orchestration.

## Error Handling

### Agent-Level Error Handling

#### Graceful Degradation Strategy

- **Primary Mode**: Full AI-powered functionality
- **Degraded Mode**: Basic rule-based responses when AI services are unavailable
- **Fallback Mode**: Static responses and manual escalation when all automated systems fail

#### Error Categories and Responses

1. **Gemini AI Service Errors**
   - Timeout: Retry with exponential backoff
   - Rate Limit: Queue requests and implement circuit breaker
   - Service Unavailable: Switch to cached responses or rule-based logic

2. **MCP Integration Errors**
   - Authentication Failure: Refresh tokens and retry
   - Service Unavailable: Use cached data when possible
   - Data Format Errors: Log error and request manual intervention

3. **A2A Communication Errors**
   - Message Delivery Failure: Implement retry with dead letter queue
   - Agent Unavailable: Continue operation without cross-agent insights
   - Protocol Errors: Log and alert for system administrator review

### System-Level Error Handling

#### Circuit Breaker Pattern

```yaml
# Circuit Breaker Configuration
circuitBreaker:
  failureThreshold: 5
  recoveryTimeout: 30s
  halfOpenMaxCalls: 3
  monitoringPeriod: 60s
```

#### Retry Policies

```yaml
# Retry Configuration
retryPolicy:
  maxAttempts: 3
  backoffStrategy: "exponential"
  initialDelay: "1s"
  maxDelay: "30s"
  jitter: true
```
