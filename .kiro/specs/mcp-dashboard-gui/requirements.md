# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a GUI-based dashboard application that provides a user-friendly interface for testing and monitoring MCP Gateway microservices. The dashboard will allow developers to interact with User Service, Transaction Service, and Product Service through the MCP Gateway at <http://localhost:8080>, providing real-time feedback on service health, API responses, and error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a GUI dashboard to test microservice endpoints, so that I can quickly validate API functionality without using command-line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard launches THEN the system SHALL display a clean interface with service selection options
2. WHEN I select a service (User, Transaction, Product) THEN the system SHALL show relevant endpoint testing options
3. WHEN I enter an endpoint path and click "Send Request" THEN the system SHALL make an HTTP request through the MCP Gateway
4. WHEN the API responds THEN the system SHALL display the JSON response in a formatted, readable manner
5. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL show clear error messages with status codes and error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see real-time service health status, so that I can quickly identify which services are operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL check health status for all configured services
2. WHEN a service is healthy THEN the system SHALL display a green UP indicator
3. WHEN a service is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL display a red DOWN indicator
4. WHEN service status changes THEN the system SHALL update indicators in real-time
5. WHEN I hover over a status indicator THEN the system SHALL show additional health details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-configured sample API calls, so that I can quickly test common endpoints without manual input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I select a service THEN the system SHALL provide sample endpoint buttons (GET /users, GET /transactions, GET /products)
2. WHEN I click a sample endpoint button THEN the system SHALL automatically populate the request and execute it
3. WHEN sample requests execute THEN the system SHALL follow the same response handling as manual requests
4. IF a sample request requires parameters THEN the system SHALL provide input fields or use default test values

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the dashboard to handle errors gracefully with retry logic, so that temporary network issues don't disrupt my testing workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic based on .env configuration
2. WHEN retry attempts are made THEN the system SHALL show retry progress to the user
3. WHEN maximum retry attempts are reached THEN the system SHALL display final error status
4. WHEN circuit breaker thresholds are met THEN the system SHALL respect circuit breaker patterns from configuration
5. IF timeout values are configured THEN the system SHALL honor timeout settings from .env file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a modular dashboard architecture, so that I can easily add new microservices without major code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new services are added to MCP_SERVICES configuration THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and include them
2. WHEN the dashboard initializes THEN the system SHALL dynamically load service configurations from environment variables
3. WHEN I add a new service configuration THEN the system SHALL create appropriate UI elements without code modification
4. IF service-specific settings exist THEN the system SHALL apply them automatically based on naming conventions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple deployment and execution, so that I can start the dashboard with a single command.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the start command THEN the system SHALL launch the complete dashboard application
2. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL automatically load configuration from .env files
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with correction guidance
5. WHEN the application is packaged THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies and assets

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an intuitive user interface, so that I can efficiently navigate between services and view responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display a sidebar with service navigation
2. WHEN I select a service THEN the system SHALL show a main panel with endpoint input and response areas
3. WHEN responses are received THEN the system SHALL format JSON with proper syntax highlighting
4. WHEN the interface is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain usable proportions and readability
5. IF multiple requests are made THEN the system SHALL maintain request history or clear previous results appropriately
